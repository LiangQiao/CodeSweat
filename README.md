This is a dumb idea. It's probably more useful for sucker like me rather than hackers.

Someone copy and paste good code here so that others can type then out. The MVP will just be a web site where people can copy paste code to share with others and most importantly, others can TYPE OUT those code rather than view the code.

The idea is to learn by writing code, to learn by coding project.

In future, people should be able to repeat a entire mini project here rather than just type them out.

If you're alredy a Ninja, you can use this to share your master piece by just copy and paste. Noobs like me would find the code snippets you post really helpful.

If you are advisable to try codacademy before you move on here.
